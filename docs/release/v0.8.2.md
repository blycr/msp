# v0.8.2

## 🎨 Frontend & Design (Neo-Industrial)
- **Visual Overhaul**: Adopted a new "Neo-Industrial" design language using **Bricolage Grotesque** (Display) and **Instrument Sans** (Body) fonts.
- **No-Scrollbar Policy**: Implemented a global hidden-scrollbar design for a cleaner, app-like experience (scrolling still works, just visual bars are hidden).
- **Dialog Redesign**: Completely restructured the "Share Settings" dialog with a grid layout and better sectioning for improved readability.
- **Component Unification**: Standardized heights (36px) and border-radius across all buttons, inputs, and toggles to resolve visual fragmentation.
- **Bug Fixes**:
  - Fixed a playlist rendering issue where it would sometimes collapse to a single item.
  - Fixed CSS syntax errors (malformed selectors).
  - Fixed alignment issues where buttons were not aligned with select boxes.

## ⚙️ Backend
- **Log Noise Reduction**: Optimized startup sequence to initialize logging before database connection, suppressing "SLOW SQL" and "record not found" noise in the terminal.
- **Database Optimization**: Adjusted GORM logger settings and SQLite connection pool for quieter and more stable operation.
