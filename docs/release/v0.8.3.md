# v0.8.3

## 📱 Mobile Experience Overhaul
- **Single-Column Layout**: Completely redesigned mobile interface to use a clean, vertical flow (Player → Playlist → Files), eliminating the cramped multi-column view.
- **Scrollable Interface**: The entire app page is now scrollable on mobile, solving issues where content was cut off on smaller screens.
- **Optimized Player**: 
  - Audio player height is now adaptive, no longer forced into a 16:9 aspect ratio.
  - Cover art size is optimized (160px) to prevent it from dominating the screen.
  - Lyrics view is now flexible and fully visible without overlapping controls.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Audio Playback**: Fixed a critical issue where audio would sometimes stop 1-2 seconds early without advancing to the next track (added an auto-recovery mechanism).
- **Layout**: Increased spacing between sections on mobile for better touch target separation.
- **CSS**: Fixed syntax errors in stylesheets that could cause build warnings.
