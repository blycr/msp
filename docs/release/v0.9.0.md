# v0.9.0

## 🚀 Frontend Architecture Rewrite
- **Vue 3 + TypeScript**: Completely rewrote the frontend from Vanilla JS to Vue 3 with Composition API and strict TypeScript support.
- **Vite**: Replaced manual scripts with Vite for lightning-fast HMR and optimized production builds.
- **Pinia**: Implemented robust global state management for playlist, config, and playback status.
- **pnpm**: Switched package manager to pnpm for faster, disk-efficient dependency management.

## 🎨 UI/UX Refinement
- **Modern Layout**: Redesigned 3-column layout (Sidebar/Stage/Playlist) with better responsiveness.
- **System Fonts**: Optimized font stack to use native system fonts (PingFang SC, San Francisco, Segoe UI) for maximum readability on all platforms.
- **Components**: Modularized Player, Sidebar, and Settings components for easier maintenance.

## 🔧 Engineering & DevOps
- **Go 1.24**: Upgraded backend to the latest Go version.
- **Docker**: Optimized multi-stage Dockerfile (Node builder -> Go builder -> Alpine runtime).
- **CI/CD**: Refactored GitHub Actions to properly cache pnpm and Go modules.
- **Scripts**: Updated PowerShell/Bash scripts (`build.ps1`, `dev.ps1`) to support the new toolchain and dynamic versioning (`-v2`).

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- **Development**: Node.js 18+ and pnpm are now required for frontend development.
- **Browser Cache**: Users may need to hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) to load the new assets.
